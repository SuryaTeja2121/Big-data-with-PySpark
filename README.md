# Big-data-with-PySpark

In this project:
  1.) We predict the delay in the arrival of  several flights across all airports.
  2.) Data preprocessing using the PySpark module has been applied to handle the heavy data
  3.) Utilized a Logistic Regression model with a Pipeline preparing the data and estimating the required feature.
